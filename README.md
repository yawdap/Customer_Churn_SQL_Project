## Project Overview

This project provides 38 comprehensive SQL queries that analyze customer churn patterns across multiple dimensions:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, income)
- Transaction behavior (spending patterns, product categories)
- Online activity (login frequency, service usage)
- Customer service interactions (resolution status, interaction types)

## Key Features

- üîç **38 Analytical Queries** covering all aspects of customer churn
- üìä **Multi-dimensional Analysis** across 4 related datasets
- üìà **Churn Rate Calculations** by various customer segments
- ‚è≥ **Temporal Analysis** comparing 2022 transactions with 2023 activity
- üéØ **High-Value Customer Identification** with targeted retention strategies

## Dataset Description

The analysis uses four primary tables:
1. **Customer_Demo**: Customer demographic information
2. **Trans_History**: 2022 transaction records
3. **Online_Activity**: 2023 online behavior metrics
4. **Customer_Service**: Customer support interactions
5. **Churn_Status**: Customer churn indicators (1=Churned, 0=Retained)


## SQL Analysis Highlights

The project includes queries that answer critical business questions such as:

- Overall churn rate and churn rates by demographic segments
- Relationship between transaction patterns and churn
- Impact of customer service interactions on churn
- Behavioral differences between churned and retained customers
- Identification of high-risk customer segments
- Temporal patterns in customer activity preceding churn

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
SQL database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
SQL client or interface to run queries
Sample dataset loaded into your database

## Usage

1. Execute individual queries to analyze specific aspects of customer churn
2. Modify queries to adapt to your specific database schema
3. Combine queries to create comprehensive reports

## Results & Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:

### Demographic Insights
- **Highest churn rates occur among**: 
  - Customers aged 25-34 (27.4% churn rate)
  - Single customers (23.1% vs 18.7% for married)
  - Mid-income earners ($50k-$75k) at 24.5%

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Customers who exhibit these behaviors are 2-3x more likely to churn**:
  - Login frequency <10 times/month (32.1% churn rate)
  - 60+ days since last transaction (41.8% churn rate)
  - Unresolved complaints (47.3% vs 14.2% with resolved issues)

### Product Analysis
- **Strongest retention correlations**:
  - Electronics purchasers (only 12.3% churn rate)
  - Customers buying 3+ product categories (9.8% churn)
  - Top 25% spenders (11.1% churn vs 28.9% bottom 25%)

### Service Impact
- **Customer service findings**:
  - Unresolved issues increase churn risk by 233% 
  - "Inquiry‚ÜíComplaint" sequence customers churn at 39.2%
  - Average 22.7 days between interactions for churners vs 35.4 for retained

### High-Risk Segments
- **Most vulnerable groups**:
  - High login frequency (>30) but unresolved complaints: 61.4% churn
  - Q4 last transaction + low 2023 activity: 53.8% churn
  - Single, mid-income, infrequent users: 44.2% churn

### Retention Opportunities
- **Strong retention indicators**:
  - Quarterly customer service touchpoints: 8.3% churn
  - Diverse product purchasers: 9.1% churn
  - Mobile app users: 14.7% churn vs 25.1% web-only
